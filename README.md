## FAQ
### Q1 Why do functions such as scrolling with the 'j' key or using the 'f' key not perform as expected?
> Due to security restrictions of Safari, if the page has a customized keypress behavior, the keypress behavior of Vimkey will be overwritten.
> The current temporary solution is to exclude the page from the Vimkey execution scope, which can be set in the Vimkey Settings

### Q2 Sometimes problems with Q1 occur accidentally on the same page
> It is recommended to turn off Safari's built-in preloading and try again.
